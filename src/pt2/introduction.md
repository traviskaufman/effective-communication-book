# Part II: Compiling Requirements to Code

> Writing a first draft is very much like watching a Polaroid develop. You can't – and, in fact, you're not supposed to – know exactly what the picture is going to look like until it has finished developing.

– Anne Lamott Brown (BIBLIO: Bird by Bird)

Focuses on taking the requirements you've gathered and mapping them into the domain of software engineering.

More philosophical than all other parts of this book so feel free to skip if you don't care.

I'm specifically _not_ going to talk about design patterns, architectural patterns, functional vs. oop vs. imperative, or anything else that's more implementation-specific. You choose which patterns work best for you. Instead, this is about _thinking about your code in a way that aligns with the product you're trying to build_.
Once you do that, choose which coding techniques you'd like to use to make it so.
