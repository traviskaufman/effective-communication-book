# Part II: Communicating Requirements as Code

> Implementation does not necessarily proceed from invention

â€“ Nassim Nicholas Taleb (BIBLIO: Antifragile)

Focuses on taking the requirements you've gathered and mapping them into the domain of software engineering.

More philosophical than all other parts of this book so feel free to skip if you don't care.

I'm specifically _not_ going to talk about design patterns, architectural patterns, functional vs. oop vs. imperative, or anything else that's more implementation-specific. You choose which patterns work best for you. Instead, this is about _thinking about your code in a way that aligns with the product you're trying to build_.
Once you do that, choose which coding techniques you'd like to use to make it so.
