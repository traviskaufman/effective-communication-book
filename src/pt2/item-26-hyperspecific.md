# Item 26: Code Hyper-Specific Solutions to Problems

Have you ever encountered a programming problem that you couldn‚Äôt find an
elegant general solution for, no matter how hard you tried? I‚Äôve seen this often
happen, especially when working on new codebases. You get stuck with the
programmer version of ‚Äúwriter‚Äôs block‚Äù. That elegant architecture that you can
ideally plug your problem into eludes you. So what do you do? If you‚Äôre like me,
at some point, you throw your hands up in the air and write ‚Äúbad‚Äù code (üò±) that
does nothing more than specifically solve exactly the instance of the problem
you‚Äôre working on; no generalization at all. I submit that _this strategy_ is
the right way to approach an unfamiliar implementation.

**Write a hyper-specific, un-generalizable solution to solve the single concrete
instance of the problem you‚Äôre facing.** Then, take a step back, figure out what
you‚Äôve learned about the problem, and rewrite it to be more general with your
newfound knowledge.

Coding hyper-specific solutions may feel unnatural (it did to me), but
hyper-specificity is how we humans learn most things in life. You (probably) did
not learn about the color "blue" by looking analyze the frequencies of light
waves, identifying where on the spectrum it occurred, and then band-pass
filtering light through a prism in a vacuum to display the pure distillation of
the color. Instead, you saw the sky, and the water, and the Blue Man Group, and
listened to that Eifel 65 song (I'm dating myself) and you figured it out from
there. Only after you saw multiple examples of things that were blue did you
learn that there is this general concept called "color" and the group of things
you're looking at belong to the "blue" category. You learned by _starting small
and concrete and then generalizing by working outwards from what you learned
from your experience._

Unfortunately, the way most institutions and literature teach coding (and most
subjects, for that matter) is the polar opposite of how we learn to walk. First,
they teach the general theory, the data structures, algorithms, tools,
frameworks, etc. Then, they show how to pattern-match these concepts to
real-world problems. This means that when practicing problem-solving outside of
a professional setting, you learn to find the most accurate general theory your
problem applies to and then apply that theory to the problem. I feel like this
is what I did when I, for example, built an example HTTP server in a book
demonstrating clean code. It implicitly teaches you _first_ to learn the theory
behind a problem and _then_ apply it.

The problem is that, in the real world, you often don‚Äôt understand the theory
behind the problems you face. Worse, it may be challenging to _find_ a theory
behind the problem. Even worse, if there is a theory on it, you may not have the
time or the resources to dive in and understand it enough to apply it to your
problem elegantly. Out of every professional programming problem I have ever
worked on, I have rarely worked on something that I readily knew the theory
behind, let alone having a theory at all.

So build your own theory instead. Solve the problem any way you can. Once you‚Äôve
done so, reflect on the solution and gain a better understanding of the problem.
Then rinse and repeat. Your elegant architecture will emerge organically with
time and reflection, and even if it doesn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs okay. You don‚Äôt need to
study light waves to appreciate the beauty of the sky.
