# Part I: Requirements Gathering

This section is devoted to taking abstract, messy, and incomplete ideas for what a product should look like,
and translating it into concrete, clean, and fully-defined software that achieves the _most accurate possible representation_ of that idea.

At the end of the day it's your job as the SWE or TL to own the implementation for you and your team.

It's not your PMs job: they can give you a high-level visiona and clarity, but cannot translate it into code. They can give you the blueprint, but it's up to you to go build the actual house.

It's not your designer's job: they can show you how the product should _look and feel_ to end users, but do not have
the skills to tell the computer what to do to achieve that look and feel.

And most of all **it is not your customer's job**. Your customer only knows that they need a problem solved, and are
looking for you to come up with a way to make a computer solve it.
