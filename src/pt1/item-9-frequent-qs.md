# Item 9: Stop for Questions Frequently

The stuff we working on is complex. When you get started explaining something, it's hard not to go off
on a tangent. However, it's likely that the longer you talk, the less people actually listen. They're trying
to keep everything in their brain, and you're overloading them with information.

**To combat information overload and zoning out, stop for questions frequently**. Basically, whenever you finish
a thought, stop and say "was that clear?" or "any questions?" or something like that.

Doing this has two key advantages:

- It gives people the chance to make sure they're on the same page as you
- It brings the attention and energy back into the room.

The science behind this is brains like to be engaged [CITATION NEEDED].

Like a TED Talk, engage your audience. That's how you'll get the most out of those requirements meetings.
