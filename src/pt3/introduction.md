# Part III: Maintaining the Codebase

People think of building software like they think of building buildings or
writing songs. But they are wrong.

**Software represents ideas. Ideas are dynamic, and ever changing. And so the
software must change with it. This is what it means to "maintain" a codebase:
you must keep it up with the flow of ideas.** Part III provides the strategies
you need to do this in a cost-effective, harmonious way. This is the most
overlooked aspect of Software Development, but it's the most important. Most
code you work on will be in codebases that you originally did not author. Most
of what you will be doing will consist of reading existing code vs. writing new
code. Therefore, maintainability is paramount because it will enable others to
do their jobs effectively.

This section will give you strategies to help _deal with change_, that corrosive
agent of entropy that affects every product and every codebase. Whether it's
changing ideas, changing people, changing external dependencies, changing
company missions, or changing frameworks, these tips will help ensure your
codebase sees longevity.
