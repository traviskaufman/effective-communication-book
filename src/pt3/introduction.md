# Part III: Maintaining the Codebase

> Writing a first draft is very much like watching a Polaroid develop. You can't – and, in fact, you're not supposed to – know exactly what the picture is going to look like until it has finished developing.

People think of building software like they think of building buildings or writing songs. But they are wrong.

**Software represents ideas. Ideas are dynamic, and ever changing. And so the software must change with it. This is what it means to "maintain" a codebase: you must keep it up with the flow of ideas.** Part III provides the strategies you need to do this in a cost-effective, harmonious way.
