# Item 47: Treat Development as a Loop vs. a Line

It's easy to get lured into developing things like features, products, or even
whole companies as a linear process: one with a beginning, a middle, and an end.
And quite frankly, that's how this book lays it out. In the beginning, you
develop a deep understanding of the requirements by absorbing information from
customers and stakeholders and synthesizing a mental model in your head. In the
middle, you implement the model you have come up with in code. And at the end,
you present that solution to your customers, and await feedback. The reality
though is that the process of doing this is so complex and so long that you need
to break it up. What's more, once you get that feedback, it's pretty much the
same as the beginning. The feedback is the requirements understanding for the
next iteration.

**Always look at development as a loop, where the end of one cycle is the
beginning of the next**.

Structure your sprints such that you're always delivering value.

Ensure that your customer feedback feeds into the next iteration.

Don't assume that a feature you build will ever be "done", instead factor it
into the next iteration of the product.

Treating development like a loop will help because it models the evolution of
ideas: a continuous process.
