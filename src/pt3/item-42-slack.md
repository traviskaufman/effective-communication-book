# Item 42: Allow for Slack

(Not done with this just yet, I want to make sure I focus on it).

This has to do with anti-fragility in codebases.

You don't want things to be "perfect" and precise. It's bad for teams, bad for
team members, etc.

Limits creativity.

You always want to inject a little bit of novelty to ensure that the codebase
stays resilient and evolves. Slack is what does this.

...I'm braindead and will continue tomorrow :)

You need to limit "exposure" of the slack and to the slack, but you do want it
to exist.

You also need to _know_ where the Slack is.

I also want to talk about the anti-pattern of homogeneity we have in software
where we all have to use one API, one library, etc. Sets us up for failure.

Slack will allow for novelty where you can discover amazing patterns.

Do it in places that are relatively non-critical.

Allows devs to try out new design patterns, experiment with ideas, "get funky"
